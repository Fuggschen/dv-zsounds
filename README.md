## Folder-Based Sound System

ZSounds now supports a simple folder-based sound system.

### Folder Structure
Organize your sounds in the following structure:

```
Sounds/
??? Generic/                    # Generic sounds (used for all trains)
?   ??? Collision/
?   ??? Coupling/
?   ??? Uncoupling/
?   ??? ...
??? LocoDiesel/                # Sounds for DE6 locomotive
?   ??? HornHit/
?   ??? HornLoop/
?   ??? Bell/
?   ??? EngineStartup/
?   ??? EngineLoop/
?   ??? EngineShutdown/
??? LocoShunter/               # Sounds for DE2 locomotive  
?   ??? HornHit/
?   ??? HornLoop/
?   ??? EngineStartup/
?   ??? EngineLoop/
??? LocoSteamHeavy/            # Sounds for SH282 locomotive
?   ??? Whistle/
??? ...
```
